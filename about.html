  <p>Abortion is one of many issues of today that is very controversial. There are potential
     laws enforced that dictates whether abortion should be declard legal or illegal by
     those who dont have the gift of giving life, men. Some believe that abortion should be
     illegal because they consider the fetus as life and that the procedures used to terminate
     the fetus are inhumane. And others believe that women are in control of there bodies and
     therefore has the right to do as they feel is right to them. This comes down to one
     question "Is it morally wrong?". The purpose of this website is to bring light to
     this cause and enlighten those who may not be familiar with the topic.
