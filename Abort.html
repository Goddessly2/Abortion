    <p>Is it morally wrong?  Should it be illegal? Are the fetus considered life?</p>
    <p>  Abortion has always been in existence. In the 1800's, it was first forbbiden ,by law, to have an abortion after 16 weeks of conception. Until it was declared illegal by the early 1900's.
      Although it was outlawed, women still found ways to do the procedure. The procedures included the use of sharp objects, such as hangers and chicken bones, swallowing gun powder,
      hitting their stomach with a meat pulverizer, consuming opium, inserting cayenne pepper into the vaginal area, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>The "Roe v. Wade case of 1973" ruled that women has the right to choose to have an abortion. The plantiff, Norma McCorvey, filed a federal law suit under the name "Jane Roe"
        to have the texas law declared unconstitutional, since it violated her constitutional right of privacy. Although the case ruled in her favor, the Surpreme Court stated that
        states are not required to ensure the well-being of the pregnant women or the unborn child. The Court divided the pregnancy into three 12 week trimesters. In the first trimester,
        the state required that the prcedure be performed by a licensed doctor. During the second trimester, the state can allow an abortion if the pregnancy threatens the health of the
        women. Lastly, the third trimester, the state protects the potential human life over the woman's privacy. At that point the woman is denied an abortion.
